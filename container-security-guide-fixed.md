# Container Security Falcon: Free Implementation Guide

A comprehensive project that demonstrates all essential DevSecOps skills through building a secure containerized microservices platform without incurring cloud costs.

## Project Overview

Goal: Build a fully automated, secure container deployment pipeline that showcases Git/GitHub, GitHub Actions, Terraform, AWS Free Tier, Docker, Kubernetes (local), monitoring, security hardening, and scripting skills.

Key Innovation: Use local Kubernetes with cloud-like monitoring and security practices to demonstrate production-ready skills at zero cost.

## Architecture Components

Infrastructure Layer
- Local Kubernetes: kind or k3s for multi-node cluster simulation
- AWS Free Tier: ECR (container registry), IAM roles, CloudWatch logs, GuardDuty
- Terraform: Infrastructure as Code for AWS resources within free tier limits

Application Layer
- Sample Microservices: 2-3 simple services (API gateway, user service, data service)
- Docker: Multi-stage builds with security hardening
- Python/Bash Scripts: Automation, scanning, and remediation tools

Security & Monitoring
- Container Scanning: Trivy (open-source) in CI/CD pipeline
- Runtime Security: Falco for anomaly detection
- Logging: Fluent Bit -> CloudWatch (within free tier)
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana (local) with CloudWatch integration

## Free Tier Cost Breakdown

AWS Free Tier Limits (2025)
- ECR: 500 MB storage per month (always free)
- CloudWatch: 5 GB logs, 10 custom metrics (always free)
- IAM: Unlimited users, roles, policies (always free)
- GuardDuty: 30-day free trial, then minimal cost for small workloads
- Lambda: 1 million requests per month, 400,000 GB-seconds (always free)

GitHub Free Tier
- Actions: 2,000 minutes per month for private repositories
- Storage: 500 MB for artifacts
- Repositories: Unlimited public repositories

Local Resources
- kind/k3s: Free, lightweight Kubernetes solutions
- Trivy: Free, open-source vulnerability scanner
- Prometheus/Grafana: Free, open-source monitoring stack
- Falco: Free, open-source runtime security

## Implementation Steps

Phase 1: Local Infrastructure Setup
1. Initialize Project Repository
   a. Create project directory and initialize Git
   b. Organize folders for workflows, Terraform, Kubernetes manifests, apps, scripts, and monitoring

2. Set Up Local Kubernetes
   a. Install kind or k3s
   b. Create a multi-node cluster configuration file
   c. Launch the cluster

Phase 2: AWS Free Tier Resources
1. Configure Terraform
   a. Define AWS provider and variables
   b. Create VPC, ECR repositories, IAM users/roles, CloudWatch log groups

2. Deploy AWS Resources
   a. Run terraform init
   b. Execute terraform apply
   c. Save output values (ECR URLs, IAM credentials) securely

Phase 3: Container Applications
1. Write Dockerfiles
   a. Use multi-stage builds
   b. Harden images: minimal base, non-root user, dropped capabilities

2. Develop Sample Microservices
   a. API Gateway using Python FastAPI
   b. User Service and Data Service (similar patterns)

3. Create Kubernetes Manifests
   a. Deployment and Service YAML files
   b. Security contexts: runAsNonRoot, readOnlyRootFilesystem, dropped capabilities

Phase 4: CI/CD Pipeline with Security
1. Security Scan Workflow
   a. Checkout code
   b. Build Docker image
   c. Run Trivy and Hadolint scans
   d. Upload reports to GitHub

2. Build and Deploy Workflow
   a. Trigger on successful scans
   b. Authenticate with AWS using GitHub Secrets
   c. Build, scan, tag, and push images to ECR
   d. Deploy to local Kubernetes cluster

Phase 5: Monitoring and Logging
1. Prometheus Setup
   a. Define scrape configs for pods and nodes
   b. Create alerting rules

2. Grafana Dashboard
   a. JSON dashboard for security metrics

3. Falco Runtime Security
   a. Deploy DaemonSet and ConfigMap
   b. Configure rule for container violations

Phase 6: Automation Scripts
1. Setup Script (Bash)
   a. Install dependencies
   b. Create kind cluster
   c. Deploy monitoring and Falco
   d. Perform initial security scan

2. Vulnerability Report Parser (Python)
   a. Parse Trivy JSON output
   b. Generate CSV and HTML reports
   c. Create remediation script based on findings

3. AWS Cost Monitoring Script (Python)
   a. Check ECR usage against 500 MB free tier limit
   b. Check CloudWatch log usage against 5 GB limit
   c. Output warnings if usage exceeds 80% of limits
